# *Non Linear Data Structures*  

- Arrange the elementd in non-Sequential Order (a heirachical Order)
- The Linier Data Structures are Trees ,Graphs , Tables , Sets etc
- The elmenents are presen at Varios levels , Soyou can't traverse Them in a single run.
- Time Complexity rtemains the same.

# *DSA Advantages ♾️* 
- Language Independent
- Improves Logic building
- Improved Problems Solving approach
- Enables to Solving Real-World Problems
- Helps in Writing optimize code
- improves adaptability to emerging tech stacks
- Helps to get Jobin Top tech companies (MAANG)

# *Common  Data Structures Operations*  
- *Insertion*
  - Insert a new Element to a DS ( Data Structures)
- *Deeletion*
  - Delete an Existing element from a Data Structure
- *Searching*
  - Search an Element Inside a Data Structure
- *Sorting*
  - Arranging   The Elements  of Data Structure in A Specific Order
- *Traversal*
  - Visit each elment inide a Data Structure Exactly Once
- *Merging*
  - Combining Two Similar Data Structure Together.
 
# *What is an Algorithm ?* 
- A step by step Procedure to solve a given Problem
- There  are two  main  criteria to judge an algirthm
  
    - `Effictiveness`
        How many steps it will take to give the desired Result ?
    - `Efficiency`
        How much Time and Memory it will take to Execute ?

# *Exmple( An Algorithm For Adding Two Numbers)* 

  ```cpp
          #include<iostream>   
          using namespace std ;    
          int main(void)  {  
          int  Number1 , Number2 ;   
          cout << "Enter The Value of Number 1 :" << enndl ;   
          cin >>  Number1 ;   
          cout << "Enter The Value of Number 2 :" << enndl ;   
          cin >> Number2 ;   
          cout << "The Result is " << Number1  + Number2 << endl ;   
          return  0 ;  

          }  
```

# *Algorithm Aanalysis*  

- Analysis of an algorithm Helps to determine the Time and Space Consumption to  Excute it .
- Helps to Predict the behavior of an Algorithm Without implementing it on a Specific Computer.
