## *What is Array?*   
---
  - An array is a fixed-size data Structures to store the same types of elements.
  - Elements are accessible by an index number.
  - Stored in contiguous memory locations . where the lowest memory address corespondes to the first element & the highest memory address corresepondes to the last element.
  - Every element of an array can be accessed in O(1) Time.

- *Exmple*

```java
int [] arr = new int[5] ;

arr[0] = 6 ; 
arr[1] = 8 ; 
arr[2] = 4 ; 
arr[3] = 3 ; 
arr[4] = 2 ;
```

## *Types of Arrays*   

- ### *Single-Dimensonal Array*
  - Elements are Stored in Rows only.
  - The address of an element can be calculated with the formula:

- ###  *Two-Dimensonal Array*
  - Elements are Stored in Rows and Columns Foramt.
  - A m x n matrix which has m rows and n columns.
  - The Storage of Array elements takes place row-Wise or column-Wise.
  - The address of an element can be calculated with the formula:

- ###  *Three-Dimensonal Array*
  - An Extension to the Two-dimensional Array with the addition of depth.
  - A cube with rows , Columns  , and depth .
  - The Storage of Array elements takes place row-Wise or column-Wise.
  - The address of an element can be calculated with the formula:

# Array Advantages  

## *Constant time Access*  
Each element in an array can access by using the index of that element in an Array   
## *Optimal memory usage* 
Arrays Stores only Data ,  with no storage waste with links or other information.




# Array  Operations    
**Traversal** :  Access elements in the array one by one. 

**Insertion** : Adds an element at the given index.   

**Deletion** : Deletes an element at the given index.  

**Search** : Search an element using the givin indis or the value. 

**Update** : Updates an elenebt at the given index.  

**Sorting** : Arrange elements in increasing or decreasing order.  

**Merging** : Merge two Sorted arrays into a larger sorted array.
